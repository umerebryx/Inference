# Inference
Create inference models from checkpoint files

Usage:
python inference_export.py --checkpoint_dir (path to dir containing checkpoint file) --export_dir (where model will get saved)

-----------------------------

deep_dream.py will read the models created by above script 'export' and use them to generate learned images.
